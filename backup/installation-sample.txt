Got it — you now have two versions of pg_dump installed:

/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_dump
/usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump


This is similar to what the Stack Overflow post describes. The idea is that when you run pg_dump from the shell, it will use whichever version is found first in your PATH. Currently, it’s likely pointing to PostgreSQL 16’s pg_dump.

If you want the system to use pg_dump version 17 by default, you have a few options:

Option 1: Use update-alternatives

This is the cleaner way:

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pg_dump pg_dump /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_dump 160
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pg_dump pg_dump /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump 170
sudo update-alternatives --config pg_dump


The last command will show a menu where you can pick the default version.

After that, pg_dump --version should show 17.x.

Option 2: Use a symlink

If you just want a quick fix:

sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump /usr/bin/pg_dump


-sf forces the symlink to point to version 17.

pg_dump --version should now show 17.

Option 3: Call full path when needed

You can leave both versions and just use the full path:

/usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump -h host -U user -d dbname > dump.sql


✅ Tip: You can do the same for psql if you want to switch the default client.

If you want, I can give you a one-liner to switch all PostgreSQL binaries to version 17 using update-alternatives. It’s cleaner than symlinking each binary individually. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
e-alternatives: using /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_dump to provide /usr/bin/pg_dump (pg_dump) in auto mode
update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump to provide /usr/bin/pg_dump (pg_dump) in auto mode
There are 2 choices for the alternative pg_dump (providing /usr/bin/pg_dump).

  Selection    Path                                Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump   170       auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_dump   160       manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_dump   170       manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — this means your system is already pointing to pg_dump version 17 by default (the * 0 line shows it’s selected in auto mode).

You can confirm by running:

pg_dump --version


You should see something like:

pg_dump (PostgreSQL) 17.6


✅ At this point, you don’t need to do anything else unless you want to manually switch between versions. If you do, you can type 1 or 2 at that prompt and hit Enter to pick a version.

Do you want me to show how to switch all PostgreSQL binaries (like psql, pg_restore, etc.) to version 17 using update-alternatives? It’s a neat way to avoid version conflicts.

is this the supbase dump file :
hassanmdala52@cloudshell:~$ export PGPASSWORD='HZWzKDdf/t?Dia7'

pg_dump -h aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com \
        -p 5432 \
        -U postgres.qzilrmaurxfpxdhrtolf \
        -d postgres \
        -Fc \
        -f ~/db_clusteer.backup

i normally download it as .gz and use gunzip to make it bakup but s this the same ?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, yes — let’s carefully unpack this.

Your command:

export PGPASSWORD='HZWzKDdf/t?Dia7'

pg_dump -h aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com \
        -p 5432 \
        -U postgres.qzilrmaurxfpxdhrtolf \
        -d postgres \
        -Fc \
        -f ~/db_clusteer.backup

What it does:

-h aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com → Connects to your Supabase database.

-p 5432 → Port number.

-U postgres.qzilrmaurxfpxdhrtolf → Database username.

-d postgres → Database name.

-Fc → Custom format for the dump (PostgreSQL’s proprietary binary format).

This is not a plain SQL file.

It allows pg_restore to restore selectively (tables, schemas, etc.).

-f ~/db_clusteer.backup → Output file.

Important distinction:

.backup from pg_dump -Fc is different from a .gz dump of plain SQL.

You do not gunzip it — it’s already a binary format.

To restore it, you use:

pg_restore -h host -p 5432 -U username -d target_db ~/db_clusteer.backup


If you had a .gz of a plain SQL dump, you would use:

gunzip file.sql.gz
psql -h host -U username -d target_db -f file.sql


✅ Summary:

.backup from -Fc → Use pg_restore, do not gunzip.

.sql.gz → Plain SQL, use gunzip then psql.

If you want, I can show a safe one-liner to restore your Supabase dump directly to another PostgreSQL database. It’s slightly different from the plain SQL method. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
i want to restore to here :
psql -h aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres.satipqspqwlkarryceri the password is the same HZWzKDdf/t?Dia7
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — since your dump is in custom format (-Fc), you’ll use pg_restore instead of psql. Here’s the exact command for your target Supabase instance:

export PGPASSWORD='HZWzKDdf/t?Dia7'

pg_restore -h aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com \
           -p 5432 \
           -U postgres.satipqspqwlkarryceri \
           -d postgres \
           -Fc \
           -v \
           ~/db_clusteer.backup

Explanation:

-h → Target host

-p → Port

-U → Username

-d → Target database (postgres)

-Fc → Tells pg_restore the file is in custom format

-v → Verbose mode (shows progress)

~/db_clusteer.backup → Your dump file

⚠️ Important notes:

Supabase PostgreSQL does not allow creating databases. You must restore into an existing database (postgres in your case).

If your dump includes roles or extensions, some may fail — that’s normal on Supabase.

Make sure the database is empty or you might get conflicts. If it’s not empty, you can add --clean to drop objects before restoring:

pg_restore --clean -h ... -d postgres ...


If you want, I can give you a full safe command that restores all tables, schemas, and sequences without touching Supabase system restrictions — so it won’t fail halfway. Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:

Ah! I see exactly what you mean — your target Supabase database is completely empty. That’s actually perfect for restoring your dump, because there won’t be any conflicts.

Here’s how you can safely restore your backup into this empty database:

export PGPASSWORD='HZWzKDdf/t?Dia7'

pg_restore -h aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com \
           -p 5432 \
           -U postgres.satipqspqwlkarryceri \
           -d postgres \
           -Fc \
           -v \
           ~/db_clusteer.backup

Notes specific to Supabase:

No existing tables → The restore will create all tables, sequences, functions, etc., from the dump.

public schema → Your dump will likely restore everything into the public schema by default.

Roles → Supabase won’t allow creating custom roles; you might see warnings about role creation — safe to ignore.

Extensions → If your dump uses extensions not installed in Supabase, those objects will fail; again, safe to ignore if you’re not using them.

✅ After running, refresh the Supabase dashboard — you should see all tables, functions, and other objects appear in the public schema.

If you want, I can give you a version of this command that automatically drops any existing objects before restoring, just in case you run this on a non-empty database later. This is a safer “full restore” approach. Do you want me to do that?
